## Motivation
With many assignments to complete, extra-curricular activites to balance, and social life to maintain, many university
students appreciate the usefulness of a daily planner. However, not only are physical ones a hassle to carry, they have
limited functionality and are time-consuming to use, which may cause students to turn away from actively journaling 
and planning, which would defeat the purpose of a daily planner in the first place. Thus, a mobile version would be a
convenient alternative! Thus, our project is an all-in-one productivity app.
